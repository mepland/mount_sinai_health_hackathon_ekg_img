## Summary
TODO

## Cloning the Repository
ssh  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mepland/mount_sinai_health_hackathon_ekg_img.git
```

https  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mepland/mount_sinai_health_hackathon_ekg_img.git
```

## Installing Dependencies
It is recommended to work in a [python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to avoid clashes with other installed software. If you do not wish to use a virtual environment you can just run the first few cells of the notebook - useful when running on cloud-based virtual machines.
```bash
python -m venv ~/.venvs/hackathon
source ~/.venvs/hackathon/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Notebook

```bash
jupyter lab waveform_preproc.ipynb
```
